 talk about my new experience on #ADB(#Android #Debug #Bridge) Tools via #Linux #OTA #Server on Real Automotive HMI Head Unit.....👌👌

🔗Prerequisites:

#Enable #Developer Options on your #Automotive  device. Go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times until you see a message saying Developer Options are enabled.
Enable USB Debugging. Go to Settings > Developer options and toggle USB debugging on.

🔗Install ADB on your Linux OS:
You can download it from the Android Developer website.
Steps to Install the App
Connect your device to your computer via USB.

Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer.

Navigate to the directory where the ADB tool is located. For example:

⏩~cd path/to/adb-directory


Verify that your device is connected. Run:

⏩~adb devices


This should list your device. If your device is not listed, ensure your USB drivers are properly installed.

Install the APK. Assuming you have the APK file you want to install, use the following command:

⏩~adb install path/to/your-app.apk
Replace path/to/your-app.apk 

with the actual path to your APK file.
or u could use one Linux Script for this job.

💻
#!/bin/bash

ADB_PATH=~/path/to/adb
APK_DIR=~/path/to/apk/files
.
.
.
echo "All APKs installed."

👉👉So let's try in real Automotive HMI ...
